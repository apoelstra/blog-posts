Hello, welcome to my blog. Its content is sourced from a git repository
[available on Github](https://github.com/apoelstra/blog-posts); corrections
or guest submissions are best submitted as pull requests there.

The blog itself is available [on my personal website](https://www.wpsoftware.net/andrew/blog/)
and should be updated from the git repository every couple of hours.

Here is a picture of me dressed as Doc Brown for Halloween in 2016.
